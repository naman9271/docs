# KubeStellar Use Cases

KubeStellar provides sophisticated multi-cluster workload management capabilities through its unique architecture and BindingPolicy system. Here are the key use cases where KubeStellar excels:

## 1. Declarative Multi-Cluster Workload Management

### Primary Use Case
Deploy and manage Kubernetes workloads across multiple clusters using native Kubernetes objects without wrapping or bundling. KubeStellar's BindingPolicy system provides declarative control over workload placement and configuration.

### Key Features
- Deploy native Kubernetes objects across clusters
- Use label-based cluster selection for workload targeting
- Maintain workload configurations in their original format
- Centralized management through Workload Definition Spaces (WDS)

### Example Scenario
```yaml
apiVersion: control.kubestellar.io/v1alpha1
kind: BindingPolicy
metadata:
  name: app-deployment
spec:
  clusterSelectors:
  - matchLabels: {"environment": "production"}
  downsync:
  - objectSelectors:
    - matchLabels: {"app.kubernetes.io/name": "myapp"}
```

## 2. Custom Resource Distribution

### Primary Use Case
Distribute and manage custom resources (CRDs) across multiple clusters while maintaining proper synchronization and lifecycle management.

### Key Features
- Support for out-of-tree workload types
- Automatic CRD synchronization
- Flexible RBAC configuration
- Status synchronization for custom resources

## 3. Advanced Status Management

### Primary Use Case
Monitor and manage workload status across multiple clusters with options for both individual and aggregated status reporting.

### Key Features
- Singleton status reporting for individual cluster monitoring
- Combined status aggregation across clusters
- Real-time status updates through OCM Status Add-On
- Comprehensive status tracking for all deployed objects

## 4. Helm Chart Distribution

### Primary Use Case
Deploy and manage Helm charts across multiple clusters while maintaining chart metadata and release information.

### Key Features
- Native Helm chart support
- Consistent release management across clusters
- Label-based chart distribution
- Helm metadata synchronization

## 5. Resilient Multi-Cluster Operations

### Primary Use Case
Maintain reliable workload distribution and management even during control plane disruptions or network issues.

### Key Features
- Resilient architecture with multiple spaces
- Automatic recovery after disruptions
- State reconciliation across clusters
- Robust error handling and recovery

## 6. Template-Based Customization

### Primary Use Case
Customize workload configurations for different clusters while maintaining a single source of truth.

### Key Features
- Support for template expansion
- Cluster-specific customization
- Property-based configuration
- Centralized template management
